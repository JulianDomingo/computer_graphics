# Overview

## Things I'll Learn
* Modern OpenGL techniques
* Create windows + handle input
* Shader Types:
    * Vertex
    * Fragment
    * Geometry
* Draw 3D models
* Use of GLM (OpenGL Maths Lib)
    * Handles vectors + matrices
    * Translate, rotate, and scale models
    * Interpolation use cases
* Indexed draws
* Projection types (orthographic / perspective)
    * 2D => orthographic
    * 3D => perspective
* Camera control + movement
* Texture mapping
* Phong lighting model
* Directional / point / spot lights
* Importing pre-made models (i.e. import from Blender)
* Shadow mapping (from multiple light sources)
    * Directional + Omni-directional
* Implement skybox
* Theory behind all above
